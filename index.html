<h1 style="color:black;">history</h1>

<p style="color:white;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/'??bd?l k?'l??m/ ?; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by INDIA.</p> 


<h1 style="color:black;">Space development</h1>
<p style="color:white;">In the very first year of its establishment, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) selected Dr. Kalam as its project director to help build India’s first indigenous satellite launch vehicle (SLV). The ten years of hard work paid off as SLV-III successfully launched the satellite Rohini into orbit in July 1980. This established India as a self reliant and exclusive member having its indigenous technology of launching satellite.</p>


<h1 style="color:black;">Students Role Model</h1>
<p style="color:white;">1. "Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough".<br>

2. “Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.” - A.P.J Abdul Kalam <br>

3. “All Birds find shelter during a rain. But Eagle avoids rain by flying above the Clouds.” - A.P.J Abdul Kalam</p>
